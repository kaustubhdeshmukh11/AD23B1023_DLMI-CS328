# Brain MRI Tumor Segmentation using Otsu & Sauvola

## Overview
This project performs brain tumor segmentation on MRI images using two classical thresholding techniques:

- Otsu Thresholding  
- Sauvola Thresholding  

The main objective is to check whether simple image processing methods can accurately detect tumor regions.

## Dataset
Dataset used: Brain Tumor Segmentation – Nikhil Tomar (Kaggle)

The dataset contains:
- MRI images  
- Ground truth masks  

---
## Methodology
### 1. Preprocessing
- CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)
- Gaussian Blur for noise removal
### 2. Segmentation Techniques
- Otsu Thresholding
- Sauvola Thresholding
### 3. Evaluation Metrics
- Dice Score
- Jaccard Score (IoU)

These metrics measure the overlap between the predicted tumor region and the ground truth mask.

---
## Results

Both Otsu and Sauvola produced very low overlap scores.

- Otsu performed slightly better than Sauvola
- Overall segmentation quality is poor

This shows that simple thresholding methods are not suitable for accurate brain tumor segmentation, and advanced methods are required.
